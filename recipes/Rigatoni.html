    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Rigatoni is a type of pasta characterized by its short, cylindrical shape
      and ridges along its surface. Originating from Italy, it is typically
      wider than penne and has a substantial bite, making it perfect for holding
      sauces. Rigatoni works well with a variety of dishes, from hearty meat
      sauces to creamy cheese blends, and is often baked in casseroles. Its
      robust structure and texture make it a favorite among pasta lovers.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>6 ounces pancetta or salt beef, diced</li>
      <li>2 ½ pounds beef chuck</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
      <li>½ cup diced carrots</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>⅔ cup white wine</li>
      <li>1 heaping tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>4 pounds yellow onions, sliced</li>
      <li>2 pounds red onions, sliced</li>
      <li>2 (16 ounce) boxes uncooked rigatoni</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh marjoram leaves</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add pancetta and cook until
        most of the fat is rendered, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate with a
        slotted spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add beef and 2 teaspoons salt to the pot. Increase the heat to high;
        cook and stir until browned and any liquid released begins to evaporate,
        10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium-high. Add cooked pancetta, celery, carrots,
        remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Add
        white wine, tomato paste, and bay leaf; cook and stir for 2 to 3
        minutes, scraping up the drippings from the bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add yellow and red onions. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook
        for 30 minutes without stirring. After 30 minutes, stir onions and meat
        until well mixed. Cover again and cook for 30 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir, then reduce the heat to low. Keep uncovered and cook, occasionally
        stirring and skimming off any fat, until beef and onions seem to melt
        into each other, 8 to 10 hours. If the sauce is reducing too much, add
        water or broth as needed to maintain a sauce-like consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the sauce is almost finished, bring a large pot of lightly salted
        water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring
        occasionally until just barely al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add rigatoni to the sauce and cook until heated through. Garnish with
        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, marjoram, and cayenne.
      </li>
    </ol>
