    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cowboy soup with beef, lots of vegetables, and a tomato base, is a hearty stick-to-your-ribs kind of meal. Leftovers are even better the next day and it freezes well, too.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can Mexican-flavored diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
        <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can pinto beans, undrained</li>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) can corn, drained</li>
        <li>1 large baking potato, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onions. Cook, breaking up beef with a spatula, until onions have softened and beef is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add green pepper, beef broth, tomatoes, beans, corn, potato, chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, and cumin. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer for 40 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls and serve.
