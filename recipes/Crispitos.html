        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 packet taco seasoning</li>
        <li>10 flour tortillas</li>

        <li>2 cups grated Cheddar cheese</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add beef and taco seasoning and cook until beef is brown and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Drain extra liquid from the skillet.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over low heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, spread a teaspoon of queso sauce onto a tortilla as "glue". Add 1/4 cup browned beef in the center and top with 2 tablespoons cheese.</li>
        <li>Roll up the tortilla and secure the roll with a toothpick. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the rolled-up tortillas into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a wire rack with a slotted spoon.</li>
        <li>Serve with salsa con queso and enjoy!</li>
